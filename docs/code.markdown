Code Conventions, Contributions, Etc.
=====================================

Sauer Code
----------

/engine and /shared contains sauer code, which we try to modify as little as possible - to make updating to the latest sauer code as easy as we can. Towards that goal,

* As mentioned, we modify as little as possible.
* When we do modify, we add comments of the form // INTENSITY - which clearly mark what is changed/added.
* If we have large amounts of code to add, we add an #include in sauer code of our code.

Conventions
-----------

TODO (meanwhile, see existing code)


Code Contributions
------------------

Code contributions are very welcome.

License-wise, the simplest thing is to contribute code under a permissive license like zlib, BSD, etc. - we already use a lot of such code anyhow, and it is easiest to combine.

The code should follow our approach to dealing with sauer code, and our coding conventions as much as possible.
